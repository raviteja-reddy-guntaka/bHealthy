bHealthy üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìä is an Android application built in Kotlin that helps users manage and track their personal health metrics over time.

It provides a user-friendly interface to record key health indicators, view historical trends, and promote healthier habits through data insights.
This project demonstrates advanced usage of:

- Modern Android app architecture (MVVM)
- Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
- Jetpack Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel)
- Data persistence and local storage
- Lifecycle-aware components

Part of my exploration into building robust, user-centric mobile apps.
